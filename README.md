# Note Taker

## Description 
    
We all take notes whether it be for school, the office, or just for our everyday life. Writing down physical notes can inefficient because you can easily lose them or forgot to take them to the place you need. The app solves this problem by creating a notes app where you can store all of your notes in one place and easily access them anytime and anywhere you have internet connection.
